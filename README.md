# Results

# Summary

I believe that this is a great idea for a business, but I believe using NYC data to pitch a business idea to Iowa is not a good idea, as the Des Moines area sees 13.7 million visitors [(Link to resources)](https://www.catchdesmoines.com/articles/post/des-moines-draws-record-number-of-visitors-to-region/) compared to NYC 66.6 millions [(Link to resources)](https://www.osc.state.ny.us/reports/osdc/tourism-industry-new-york-city#:~:text=New%20York%20City%20hosted%2066.6,reduction%20(see%20Figure%201).


With this being said, I still believe this is a good business idea but I have 2 suggestions.
1. It would be ideal if we could compare similar local business to see if this would be profitable, if there are no such business, maybe we could look at another city simila to Des Moines' data.
2. Maybe we can cater this business towards future subscribers in the Des Moines area, as I can only imagine there would be lots of people who like the bike to work in the warm months.
